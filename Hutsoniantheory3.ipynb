            "          \"The Aaron Copland collection consists of published and unpublished music by Copland and other composers,  correspondence, writings, biographical material, datebooks,  journals, professional papers, including legal and financial material, photographs, awards, art work, and books. Of particular interest is the correspondence with Nadia Boulanger, which extend over 50 years, and with his long-time friend, Harold Clurman. Other significant correspondents are Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, Carlos Cha\\u0301vez, David Diamond, Roy Harris, Charles Ives, Claire Reis, Arnold Schoenberg, Roger Sessions, and Virgil Thomson. The photographic collection of Copland's friend and confidant Victor Kraft, a professional photographer, forms part of the collection.\",\n",
            "          \"The Music series is divided into to two subseries. The Music by Aaron Copland subseries represents almost all of the entire musical creation of Copland beginning with the early, youthful student works and ending with the short piano pieces in the seventies and eighties. The Music by Othe Composers subseries includes manuscripts, fascimiles, and printed music which were part of Copland's extensive collection of music. Most contain holograph annotations either in Copland's hand, especially his conducting scores, or signed by the composer or donor. These scores and the other published works from his collection, which became part of the Performing Arts Library at the New York Public Library, illustrate a broad, composite spectrum of composers in the Western Hemisphere.\",\n",
            "          \"The Writings & Oral Presentations series represent over fifty years (c. 1925-1988) of written and oral commentary on music and musicians during the lifetime of Copland. The writings by Aaron Copland subseries contains the different venues that Copland employed to communicate his thoughts and ideas on music -- the growth of American music and commentary on the people or organizations that fostered composers and their music through the 1960s -- beginning in 1925 with his second published article, 'What Europe Means to the Aspiring Composer,' after his return from three years of musical study in France. The Writings by Others subseries extends to material written about Aaron Copland and material written about other composers, musicians, and critics or other subjects. The articles reflect the views and opinions of a wide range of notable people. The interviews almost span his entire life from 1928 to 1988 and comprise dialogues with substantive and substantial quotes by Copland. The ballet scripts contain an intriguing scenario, Memorial Day, Dances for Democracy in Crisis, which identifies the collaborators -- conceived by Lincoln Kirstein, Lew Christensen as the general stage director, music by Copland, choreography by Lew Christensen, Erick Hawkins, Eugene Loring, and the costumes by Jared French. Evidently, the ballet never developed beyond this scenario which includes forty-eight watercolor drawings.\",\n",
            "          \"The Diaries series is subdivided into two subseries, Datebooks and Journals. The Datebooks subseries ranges from 1935 to 1985, except for the year 1954, and were generally used to briefly record his daily activities. The desk size books from 1942 to 1969 also enumerate the commissions offered to him by individuals and/or organizations. The pocket size books were apparently used during domestic or foreign trips. The Journals subseries consists of notebooks which record activities, list items and report on events and trips. The material dates from his 1910 reminiscences and extends to comments about his 1973 European trip. The journal dated from 1941-1973 includes family genealogy charts. Two journals describe the creation of the music scores for two films, The Red Pony and Something Wild. The date spans represent the actual span of year dates noted in the journal. Because of the fragile nature of some journals, the originals and archival photocopies will not be served to researchers. Photocopies of the journals, which are placed in binders, will be available to researchers. See the Index for Journals with AC Numbers for an explanation and list of the journals in numeric order.\",\n",
            "          \"The Correspondence series is subdivided into two subseries. The Personal Correspondence subseries contains letters to and from Copland with his family, teachers, fellow composers, literary figures, personal friends and acquaintances. Of particular interest are the letters with Nadia Boulanger, which extent over 50 years, and the letters with his long-time friend, Harold Clurman. Other significant correspondents are Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, Carlos Cha\\u0301vez, David Diamond, Roy Harris, Claire Reis, Roger Sessions, Charles Ives, Arnold Schoenberg, and Virgil Thomson. The General Correspondence subseries comprises a variety of day-to-day mail, which Copland reviewed, from individuals and businesses. The letters include requests to lecture and conduct and for permissions, birthday and holiday greeting cards from family, friends and school children, and fan mail.\",\n",
            "          \"The Professional Papers series is subdivided into two subseries, the Business Organizations and the Engagements. The Business Organizations subseries includes records that pertain to Copland's affiliation with and service for various private, public, and governmental agencies, organizations, and councils, at the local, national, and international level and material that relate to numerous publishers, agents and foundations. Voluminous records exist for the Arrow Music Press (formerly, Cos Cob Press), for which Copland served as Treasurer, and for Boosey & Hawkes, his music publisher, which include letters about score corrections for his music. Other significant material are the Copland-Sessions Concerts of Contemporary Music, the Koussevitzky Music Foundation, the League of Composers, Modern Music, the Edward MacDowell Association, and Tanglewood which includes material on the Berkshire Music Center and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Engagements subseries represents correspondence and other material between organizations for which Copland performed, spoke or conducted, or from whom he was bestowed an award or honor. The organizations include orchestras, universities and colleges, festivals, museums, and societies. The most notable events are his trips to Latin America in 1941 and 1947 and his frequent appearances with the London Symphony, New York Philharmonic, and National Symphony orchestras.\",\n",
            "          \"The Subject File series is a composite of printed matter and material on special subjects that Copland kept. The largest and most extensive is the Composition section which consists of published clippings, magazine articles, promotional material, annotated programs and other miscellaneous items relating to performances of his compositions.\",\n",
            "          \"The Scrapbooks series includes four scrapbooks. Three of the four scrapbooks focus on specific undertakings by Copland -- the Copland-Sessions Concerts from 1924 to 1931, the Yaddo Festivals from 1932-33, and the 1978 Australian tour for which he conducted and lectured. The other scrapbook represents the beginnings of Copland's clipping file from 1924 to 1942. All, but the Australian tour scrapbook, have been preserved on microfilm because of their fragile condition (Microfilm 93/20002 Mus); the original of these three volumes will not be served to the public.\",\n",
            "          \"The Biography series consists of divergent materials, some of which is biographical and others personal. The biographical material includes autobiographical notes, a notebook and assorted lists that pertain to Copland's activities and compositions, and two birthday albums. The 70th birthday album comprises \\\"An album of composers' tributes\\\" which contains congratulatory letters, musical salutes, poems and ink drawings from 116 composers. The 80th birthday album was presented by the National Symphony Orchestra from friends and includes congratulatory letters from President Jimmy Carter, Vice President Walter Mondale, conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, Roger L. Stevens (chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts), and international musical luminaries.\",\n",
            "          \"The Awards series contains the artifacts that Copland received from the numerous and myriad honors and awards bestowed on him during his lifetime. Copland accepted his first honorary doctorate in music from Princeton University in 1956, and almost every year thereafter he approved another one either in humane letters or in music. The last one was a Degree of Fine Arts, Honoris Causa, from the New School for Social Research in 1983. Other tributes conferred on Copland from 1947 to 1982 include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and the Kennedy Center Honors' medal in 1979. In most cases, programs, invitations, and letters accompany the actual degree, award or medal.\",\n",
            "          \"The Art Works series is divided into Of Aaron Copland, Other Works, Poetry, and Posters that include drawings, caricatures, and portraits of Aaron Copland and other artistic renderings which consist of special editions of illustrated poems by various artists in different mediums. The two most illustrious artists represented are a numbered print by Pablo Picasso and an engraved color print by Marc Chagall which was part of an invitation from the Prince and Princess of Monaco for a 1967 program to honor Nadia Boulanger.\",\n",
            "          \"The Photographs series contains approximately 12,000 images and dates from c. 1889-1985. The largest section is the portraits of Copland alone, both formal and informal, professional and amateur. Noteworthy subjects include many rarely-seen early portraits of Aaron Copland and the majority of the photographs reproduced in Copland's two volume autobiography, 'Copland, 1900-1943' (Volume I) and 'Copland Since 1943' (Volume II).\",\n",

Victor Kraft (1915-1976) was a professional photographer and life-long friend of Aaron Copland. They first became acquainted in the early 1930's and maintained close contact until Kraft's death. Notable subjects include formal and informal portraits of Aaron Copland, and portraits from the 1940s and 1950s of numerous composers and performers of the American music scene, including Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles, Edwin Denby, Lukas Foss, Erik Johns, William Kapell, Dmitri Mitropoulos, and Robert Shaw.\",\n",

Most are signed, usually by the author, or contain annotations or information about Copland. The books reflect Copland's wide and varied interests and include those books written by Copland and translated into various languages. Many books concentrate on Copland's interest in French culture after his years of study in Paris.\"\n",

On December 8, 1941 (the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), Alan Lomax, then \\\"assistant in charge\\\" of the Archive of American Folk Song (now the American Folklife Center archive), sent a telegram to fieldworkers in ten different localities across the United States, asking them to collect \\\"man-on-the-street\\\" reactions of ordinary Americans to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent declaration of war by the United States. A second series of interviews, called \\\"Dear Mr. President,\\\" was recorded in January and February 1942. Both collections are included in this presentation. They feature a wide diversity of opinion concerning the war and other social and political issues of the day, such as racial prejudice and labor disputes. The result is a portrait of everyday life in America as the United States entered World War II.\"\n",

Prior to and during much of the Edo period (1600-1868), the range of Ainu communities also extended south across parts of northern Honshu, the largest of the four major islands that comprise modern Japan, in addition to the eastern Amur River region and southern Kamchatka.\"\n",

Research for the book necessitated extensive travel throughout Europe to collect libretti including many first and early Italian, German and French editions from the 17th and 18th centuries: in the end, his collection totaled 12,000 operatic and 238 oratorio and cantata libretti.\"\n",

Dates span from 1862 to 1939, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1865 to 1920. Included among Bell's papers are pages from his experimental notebook from March 10, 1876, describing the first successful experiment with the telephone, during which he spoke through the instrument to his assistant the famous words, \\\"Mr. Watson--Come here--I want to see you.\\\" Bell's various roles in life as teacher, inventor, celebrity, and family man are covered extensively in his papers. Complementing the Bell Papers are digital images of photographs from the Gilbert H. Grosvenor Collection in the Library's Prints and Photographs Division.\"\n",

The collection, consisting of approximately 12,000 items dating from 1708 to 1917, documents Hamilton's impoverished Caribbean boyhood (scantily); events in the lives of his family and that of his wife, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton; his experience as a Revolutionary War officer and aide-de-camp to General George Washington; his terms as a New York delegate to the Continental Congress (1782-1783) and the Constitutional Convention (1787); and his careers as a New York state legislator, United States treasury secretary (1789-1795), political writer, and lawyer in private practice. Most of the papers date from 1777 until Hamilton's death in 1804. Additional details may be found in the collection's finding aid (HTML and PDF versions).\"\n",

This anniversary is historically significant, and this significance is reflected in the number and diversity of the associated websites. This web archive will serve as a useful tool for researchers in studying the American Civil War and its memorialization. Over 200 sites comprise this archive. Some sites document Civil War reenactments and living history events. Some are specific to aspects of the war or collections of war-related materials. Other sites have a reflective, solemn tone, rather in contrast to the more celebratory events seen during the 1961-1965 Civil War Centennial. Most sites are location or region specific, showing that much as it was 150 years ago, the Civil War was and remains to be a locally important part of American cultural history and identity. Many organizations, government bodies at all levels, and individuals created an online Sesquicentennial presence, often times instead of or in addition to print materials. This archive will act as a tool for researchers wanting to study the Civil War Sesquicentennial (2011-2015) in comparison to the Civil War Centennial (1961-1965) and other commemorative events in form, content and in the context it took place among other events going on in American society at the time.\"\n",

The American Colony was founded in 1881 by a small group of American expatriates and their associates in Ottoman Palestine. The collective community expanded greatly in numbers in 1896 with an influx of Swedish millennialist migrants and members of Arab Christian and other heritage backgrounds. It operated businesses, provided social welfare services during World War I, and continued to thrive and contribute to the civic life of Jerusalem throughout the British Mandate period. The collection was donated to the Library of Congress between 2004 and 2009 by the board of directors of the American Colony of Jerusalem, Ltd., which is made up of American, British, and Swedish descendants of the early members.\"\n",

Collectors and interviewees vary, representing 43 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and parts of Canada. The recordings submitted for the project were made between circa 1935 and 1984, a number are undated; the bulk of the recordings are dated from 1968 to 1982.  The survey's documentation covers social aspects of English language usage including sex differences; differences between black and white speakers; class distinctions; education; age; literacy; ethnic background for some speakers; and occupational speech, including specialized jargon or vocabulary of various occupations in different regions of the United States. Some of the oral history interviews include storytelling; folklore; family histories; descriptions of holiday celebrations; traditional farming; floods; health care and uses of traditional medicines; descriptions of schools and education; discussions of race relations, politics, and many other topics.

            "          \"The Nation's Forum Collection at the Library of Congress consists of 59 acoustic recordings of speeches, delivered without a public audience solely for the purposes of preserving the speakers' voices. With two exceptions, the reverse side of the original records consisted of patriotic music. The recordings can be placed into two distinct series, 1918 and 1919-1920. Devoted mainly to World War I topics, the 1918 series was not sold commercially but distributed only to political organizations and other groups on ten-inch discs. The notable exception was the commercially-distributed recording of \\\"From the battlefield of France\\\" by General John J. Pershing, backed by U.S. Ambassador James Gerard's \\\"Loyalty.\\\" Other speakers in the 1918 series were labor leader Samuel Gompers, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, Senators Warren G. Harding and James Hamilton Lewis, Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, Speaker of the House Champ Clark, financier Frank A. Vanderlip, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, and writer Richard A. Purdy. Of the fifteen 1918 recordings at the Library, the Pershing/Gerard record is an original shellac disc, 11 records are modern vinyl test pressings struck from original masters, and two recordings are audio tape dubs.\",\n",
            "          \"CONT.: The 1919-1920 series was devoted primarily to the 1920 presidential election and postwar issues. Recordings in this series were released at a rate of two per month, one Republican and one Democrat, on twelve-inch discs for two dollars each. The 1919-1920 series includes Democratic speakers Franklin D. Roosevelt, William G. McAdoo, Mitchell Palmer, Stephen S. Wise, Bainbridge Colby, James W. Gerard, Champ Clark, Homer S. Cummings, Robert L. Owen, James M. Cox, George White, Newton D. Baker, and Gilbert M. Hitchcock; and Republican speakers Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding, Henry Cabot Lodge, Leonard Wood, Nicholas Murray Butler, Will H. Hays, and Corinne Roosevelt Robinson. Indicating that the Nation's Forum project may also have planned to record foreign statesmen, the collection includes recordings of three speeches by Eamonn De Valera, who led the fight to establish the Republic of Ireland. The label of one De Valera recording states that with the sale of each record, a royalty of twenty-five cents would be paid to Dale Eireann, the revolutionary Irish Parliament. Of the Library's 44 recordings from the 1919-1920 series, 24 are original shellac discs, 17 are modern vinyl pressings from original masters, and three are audio tape dubs.\"\n",

Typically 2,000-15,000 words in length, the documents vary in form from narratives to dialogues to reports to case histories. They chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others. The documents often describe the informant\\u2019s physical appearance, family, education, income, occupation, political views, religion and mores. Pseudonyms are often substituted for individuals and places named in the narrative texts. The life histories comprise a small part of the larger Manuscript Division collection titled United States Work Projects Administration Records.\"\n",

Although many of the authors represented in American Notes are not widely known, the collection includes works by major figures such as Matthew Arnold, Fredrika Bremer, William Cullen Bryant, Fran\\u00e7ois-Ren\\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, William Cobbett, James Fenimore Cooper, J. Hector St. John de Cr\\u00e8vecoeur, Charles Dickens, Washington Irving, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sir Charles Lyell, William Lyon Mackenzie, Andr\\u00e9 Michaux, Thomas Nuttall, Frederick Law Olmsted, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The narratives in American Notes therefore range from the unjustly neglected to the justly famous, and from classics of the genre to undiscovered gems.

Included are 334 English- and Yiddish-language playscripts, 146 theater playbills and programs, 61 motion pictures, 10 sound recordings and 143 photographs and 29 memorabilia items documenting the life and career of Harry Houdini.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \\\"legitimate\\\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \\\"vaudeville\\\" and \\\"extravaganza\\\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \\\"respectable.\\\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\\\"/item/var95-000382/\\\"><img      src=\\\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\\\"      width=\\\"150\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\\\"/item/var95-000382/\\\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.  The <a href=\\\"/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/articles-and-essays/forms-of-variety-theater/\\\">forms of variety theater</a> represented in this collection draw from several genres, including  vaudeville, minstrel show, burlesque, extravaganza, spectacle, musical  revue, and musical comedy.</p>\"\n",

The goal of the FCP (1977-1987) was to gather together thousands of such historical recordings held at the Library, in national and international repositories, at universities, and in private collections; produce catalog records; preserve the audio on reel-to-reel tape; and make the recordings available to communities of origin. In particular, the initiative focused on some 9,000 cylinder recordings of Native American cultural expressions, with the aim of sharing copies with those communities to further their work in linguistic maintenance and reclamation and ownership of cultural heritage. Between 1983 and 1988, thanks in part to a grant of $118,000 from the Ford Foundation, FCP project staff -- including scholars from the Library, the Smithsonian Institution, and public universities -- visited approximately 100 tribal communities and returned cassette copies of cylinder recordings (cassette being the most accessible format at the time).\"\n",
